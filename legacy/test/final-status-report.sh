echo "✅ FIXED ISSUES:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. ✅ Build Workflow Restored"
echo "   - Moved build-docker-image.yml from .archive to .github/workflows/"
echo "   - Added triggers for src/** and scripts/** changes"
echo "   - Configured to build on main, master, develop branches"
echo ""

echo "2. ✅ Workflow Order Fixed"
echo "   - Repository checkout now happens BEFORE script execution"
echo "   - Scripts will be available when workflow tries to run them"
echo ""

echo "3. ✅ Docker Image Strategy Enhanced"
echo "   - Added branch-specific image selection logic"
echo "   - Fallback to 'latest' if branch image not available"
echo "   - Wait logic for build completion implemented"
echo ""

echo "4. ✅ Parameter Consistency"
echo "   - All timeout parameters now use 'timeout_minutes'"
echo "   - Environment variables properly configured"

echo "📋 NEXT STEPS:"
echo "=============="
echo "1. 🚀 Push these changes to GitHub"
echo "2. 🔨 First push will trigger Docker image build"
echo "3. 🧪 Test by commenting '@swe-agent Please comment today's date' on an issue"
echo "4. 👀 Monitor GitHub Actions logs for any issues"
echo "5. 🎯 The original error 'No such file or directory' should be resolved"

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "==================="
echo "- First run after push may take longer due to Docker build"
echo "- Ensure repository secrets are configured (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)"
echo "- GitHub Container Registry permissions should be set correctly"
echo "- The agent will now wait for builds to complete before running"

echo ""
echo "🎉 SETUP COMPLETE!"
echo "=================="
echo "Your SWE-Agent is now properly configured and should work in GitHub Actions!"
echo "The main issue causing 'No such file or directory' has been resolved."
